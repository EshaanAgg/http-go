This repository hosts my Go solution to the ["Build Your Own HTTP server" challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) by [Codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, we build a `HTTP/1.1` server that is capable of serving multiple clients. Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers, [HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html), and more.

## Salient Features

- Developed without any external dependencies
- Follows the actual HTTP spec to the dot
- Allows multiple concurent client as well as persistence of connection
- Supports HTTP compression
